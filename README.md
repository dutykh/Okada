Okada solution (1985)
======

This script computates the static co-seismic displacements due to a dislocation-type deformation in a half-space

Description: This exact solution is often used to construct co-seismic displacements due to an underwater earthquake. These displacements are then used to construct in some way an initial condition for tsunami propagation codes.

For more details, please, have a look at the original Okada paper:
